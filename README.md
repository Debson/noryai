Congratulations for making it to the challenge stage of the interview process! This challenge is designed to test your Frontend software development skills. It will likely take 2-3 hours total.

If you find it's taking longer than 3 hours, just wrap up what you have and finish off with some pseudo-code to explain what you would do next. Seeing how you prioritize under time restrictions is really useful too.

This challenge mimics the type of work we do at Nory, and so it should give you a sense of what the day-to-day is like.

After you complete this challenge we will have a meeting where you will present and discuss this project, see more details in the [What We'll Talk about in the Call Section](#what-well-talk-about-in-the-call).

## Overview


Your challenge if you choose to accept it, is to build a **Navbar** component feature with a placeholder screen for the Nory web application. This component will be used to toggle and navigate around the applicationâ€™s modules based on URL and display content.

Our customersâ€™ device usage is as follows:

-   40% laptop screens
-   30% tablets
-   30% mobile phones

Based on these stats, the component has to be fully responsive across devices, starting at 320px wide.

For the purpose of this task, there are no interactions on this screen outside of:

-   Hover states, marked with a mouse pointer icon
-   Navigating to different screens with URL change.
-   Displaying placeholder text and image via making an api call to [https://dog.ceo/dog-api/](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

Our layout grid, container size, colors, font sizes, and other specs are all available in the Figma file below, so be sure to inspect the linked Figma file and prototype thoroughly! You may need to create a free Figma account to access the Inspect functionality.

Our web app UI uses 3rd party components for buttons, icons and forms, with our own styling applied. You can find the library at [](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started)[https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started)

Please include a readme document with your submission. Weâ€™re interested in how you approach the task and structure your work, as well as high-quality execution.

### Technical Requisite

1.  **Must** - use **React** Functional components and Hooks.
2.  **Must** - Use and setup **Redux** for managing the Navigation bar and URL states. (Other main content of other navigation states can be empty placeholder)
3.  **Must** - Have **Integration test** for the components built and api calls.
4.  **Should have** - Efficient use of SCSS.
5.  **Should have** - Proper use of git and a professionally managed project (commit early and commit often).

Please create your own git repository for this exercise.

## What We'll Talk About in the Call

Once you've completed the challenge let us know and will set up a call where we can talk through it. 

We'll ask questions about what approach you took and why. We'll ask questions about what assumptions you might have made, and why.

From there we will also look at the code and hear any decisions that you have made.  

And of course, we want to hear your thoughts and answer any questions you have.


## tl;dr

So that's that. How does it sound? A whole lot of details, we know !!!

**Oh, and one last thing... best of luck! We're really happy you've decided to take part in the challenge, and we look forward to seeing your epic solution.** ðŸ˜Ž
